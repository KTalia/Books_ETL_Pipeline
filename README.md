# 📚 Book ETL Pipeline Project

This is a personal ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project that automates the process of scraping book data from Literatura.mk, storing it in a PostgreSQL database, and exporting it to CSV files for analysis and visualization. The project aims to extract insights on book pricing, categories, and trends over time.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Data processing and automation (Selenium, Pandas)
- **Apache Airflow** – Workflow orchestration using DAGs for task scheduling
- **Docker** – Containerization and environment setup
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database to store scraped data efficiently
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation for insights
- **ChromeDriver + Selenium** – Headless web scraping for automated data collection

---

## Features

- 🔁 Automated Weekly Scraping using Airflow
- 💾 Stores structured data in PostgreSQL
- 📤 CSV export for Power BI
- 📊 Visualizations in Power BI
- 🐳 Fully containerized with Docker

## How It Works

1. **Extract:**  
   Scrapes book title, author, category, and price from the Literatura.mk site using Selenium.

2. **Transform:**  
   Cleans and processes data using Pandas, filling missing values and standardizing fields.

3. **Load:**  
   Stores the processed data in a PostgreSQL database and exports a snapshot to CSV for further     analysis.
4. **Visualize:**  
   Data is analyzed in Power BI via imported CSVs, with charts for:
   - Category distribution  
   - Price outliers

## Airflow DAG Overview

The DAG `fetch_and_store_books` is scheduled to run weekly and performs the following steps:

1. **create_table** – Ensures the PostgreSQL tables (`books` and `book_prices`) exist.
2. **fetch_book_data** – Uses Selenium to scrape up to 20,000 books from literatura.mk and pushes the data to Airflow XCom.
3. **insert_book_data** – Inserts new books into the `books` table and tracks their prices over time in `book_prices`.
4. **export_data_to_csv** – Exports data from both tables into timestamped CSV files for Power BI analysis.

Tasks are executed in the following order:

```text
create_table --> fetch_book_data --> insert_book_data --> export_data_to_csv
```

## Power BI Dashboard

1. **Total Unique Books:**  
   Displays the total number of unique book titles: **20K**.

2. **Average Book Price by Category:**  
   Bar chart showing average prices across different book categories. The highest average is **990 ден** for one category, with others ranging down to about **442 ден**.

3. **Count of Title by Category (top right):**  
   Pie chart indicating the distribution of titles across categories. The dominant category **Книги на англиски јазик** holds 74.5% of the titles.

4. **Count of Category by Author:**  
   Horizontal bar chart showing how many categories each author contributes to.

5. **Sum of Price with Fluctuation by Year, Month, and Day:**  
   - Line chart visualizing daily book price fluctuations.  
   - **Note:** I used additional dummy data for this chart since I have only 2 weeks of project data and there haven't been significant changes in this period. The chart also includes a forecasting line to estimate future trends and a trending line to visualize price movement over time.

6. **Count of Title by Year, Month, and Day:**  
   - Line chart showing how the number of book titles varies over time.  
   - **Note:** This chart also uses dummy data, as I haven't had enough time to collect a larger dataset. As a result, visible changes are not yet apparent in this short period.

## Notable Challenges
- Running Selenium and ChromeDriver in a headless Docker container
- Scraping dynamically loaded content with Selenium
- Passing data between Airflow tasks using XCom
- Managing missing or inconsistent data during the scraping process
---
## Future Changes/Additions
- **Expand Data Sources & Price Comparison** – Integrate additional websites for scraping book data and create visualizations to compare prices for the same books across different platforms.
- **Advanced Visualizations** – Add price trend analysis and category-based insights in Power BI.
- **Machine Learning for Pricing Predictions** – Incorporate machine learning models (e.g., regression, time series forecasting) to predict future book prices or category trends based on historical data.
